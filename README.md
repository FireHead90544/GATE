A simple personal web-app to get stream-able playlists for GATE lectures subscribed from PW

### Why?
- The PW's web-app doesn't support multiple sessions accross multiple devies.
- The web-app's bloated.
- I prefer minimal things.
- Playlists can be further easily streamed using VLC/MPD.

### Note
- This isn't a *hacky-hack* sort of thing.
- You'd need the batch subscribed on your account.
- Furthermore, the resource structure should be self-scraped and formatted and stored in a `json` file.
- I won't be pushing the same to the repo, though I'll provide a sample structure which could be used with this web-app.
- I might publish the scraping logic if I feel like doing so, but no help would be whatsoever provided regarding that.
- I won't be responsible for any legal stuffs you get into, this is a personal project and I'm not promoting any kind of piracy.
